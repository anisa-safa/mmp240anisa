<h2>Recipe Notes</h2>


<h3>What is toffee pudding?</h3>
<p>Toffee pudding is the term used in the US for what we refer to as sticky date pudding. Their version may or may not contain dates, which seems a shame as when they break down, they add an even extra sweet caramel flavour as well as adding moisture to the pudding. </p>

<h3>Can you freeze sticky date pudding?</h3>
<p>Leftover pudding should be transferred to an airtight container and frozen for up to two months. Make sure you freeze the cake and the sauce separately. Thaw in the fridge overnight and warm in the microwave or warm the cake in the oven and the sauce in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. </p>

<h3>How long does sticky date pudding last?</h3>

<p>Because this cake is so moist and tender and laden with sugar it stays fresh for up to a week. Store in an airtight container in the fridge. Once reheated, it’s like it’s fresh from the oven.</p>
